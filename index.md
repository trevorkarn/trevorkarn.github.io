### teaching

i have taught the following classes at UMN:

- linear algebra and differential equations (math 2243), fall 2020, spring 2021
- calculus ii (spring 2020, fall 2021)
- calculus i (fall 2019)

### open source development

i'm a fan of python. in particular, sagemath.
since 2020 i have been contributing to sagemath.
[here are some things i've done in sagemath](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?owner=tkarn&status=closed&status=positive_review&or&author=~Trevor+K.+Karn&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority).

in summer 2021 i participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6722452844969984) with sagemath.

### prelims 

check out [complex analysis preliminary written exam solutions](https://github.com/trevorkarn/umn-complex-prelim) and 
[manifolds and topology preliminary written exam solutions](https://github.com/trevorkarn/umn-topology-prelim). 
i am no longer actively updating them, so please make pull requests
to keep them up-to-date!

### combinatorics seminar

in 2021, the UMN student algebra and combinatorics seminar organizers are Robbie Angarone, Carolyn Stephen, and Sasha Pevzner. the schedule can be found at [Sasha's website](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~pevzn002/SCAS/student_seminar_f21.html)

[here](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~karnx018/2020.html) is the schedule of speakers from 2020
