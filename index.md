### open source development

i'm a fan of python. in particular, sagemath.
since 2020 i have been contributing to sagemath.
[here are some things i've done in sagemath](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?owner=tkarn&status=closed&status=positive_review&or&author=~Trevor+K.+Karn&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority).

in summer 2021 i participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6722452844969984) with sagemath. 
i [did it again](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/UpKWcuIO) in 2022.

### combinatorics seminar

i helped to organize the 2020 UMN student combinatorics seminar.
[here](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~karnx018/2020.html) is the schedule of speakers that year.
