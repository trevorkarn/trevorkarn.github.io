## about 

i'm a Visiting Assistant Professor (non-tenure track) at Texas A\&M University.
i earned my Ph.D. in 2025 under the supervision of [Vic Reiner](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/).
here is [my cv](/assets/karn_CV.pdf).

my research interests are in algebraic combinatorics and
applied topology

my pronouns are he/him

## open source development

i'm a fan of python. in particular, sagemath.
since 2020 i have been contributing to sagemath.
[here are some things i've done in sagemath](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+trevorkarn+).

in summer 2021 i participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6722452844969984) with sagemath. 
i [did it again](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/UpKWcuIO) in 2022.


## MRWAC

i am helping to organize the 2024 [Minnesota Research Workshop in Algebra and Combinatorics](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/mrwac/home) (aka MRWAC, pronouced like the Pokemon). 
it is a research workshop to strengthen research connections between UMN graduate students, postdocs and alumni in combinatorics and algebra.

## combinatorics seminar

i helped to organize the 2020 UMN student combinatorics seminar.
[here](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~karnx018/2020.html) is the schedule of speakers that year.
