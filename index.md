## teaching
i have lectured the following classes at UMN:

- math 5251: [error-correcting codes, finite fields, algebraic curves](https://trevorkarn.github.io/5251), spring 2023, spring 2025
- math 1272: calculus ii, fall 2022 (in-person), [spring 2024](https://trevorkarn.github.io/1272) (online)

i have t.a.'d the following classes at UMN:

- math 2243: linear algebra and differential equations, fall 2020, spring 2021
- math 1272: calculus ii, spring 2020, fall 2021
- math 1271: calculus i, fall 2019

## open source development

i'm a fan of python. in particular, sagemath.
since 2020 i have been contributing to sagemath.
[here are some things i've done in sagemath](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+trevorkarn+).

in summer 2021 i participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6722452844969984) with sagemath. 
i [did it again](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/UpKWcuIO) in 2022.

## notes

## MRWAC

i am helping to organize the 2024 [Minnesota Research Workshop in Algebra and Combinatorics](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/mrwac/home) (aka MRWAC, pronouced like the Pokemon). 
it is a research workshop to strengthen research connections between UMN graduate students, postdocs and alumni in combinatorics and algebra.

## combinatorics seminar

i helped to organize the 2020 UMN student combinatorics seminar.
[here](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~karnx018/2020.html) is the schedule of speakers that year.
