# math 1272 - calculus ii

in the spring of 2024, i taught math 1272 online throught the University of Minnesota.
as a part of that, i put together a set of beamer slides that closely follow chapters 7-12 of James Stewart's *Calculus Early Transcendentals* 8th edition.

in case these slides are helpful to you, here are the

- [raw LaTeX files](https://trevorkarn.github.io/assets/1272/math1272slidessp24raw.zip), and
- [pdfs with worked examples](https://trevorkarn.github.io/assets/1272/math1272slidessp24.zip)

there are some typos in the worked pdfs. i have tried to correct them in the raw LaTeX files, but if you notice any, please contact me so i can correct them.

i also have various quizzes and relevant SageMath Jupyter notebooks available to instructors upon request.
