# math 5251 - error correcting codes, finite fields, algebraic curves

this is a course about the mathematics of transmiting information.
it is *not* a course about encoding/decoding messages for secrecy (cryptology).

we will primarily use [Paul Garrett's book](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~garrett/coding/CodingNotes.pdf) on the subject.
here is an [*unofficial* errata](https://trevorkarn.github.io/assets/5251/pgerrata.pdf) for the book.
the book is legally available for free on Garrett's website. [here are some more resources from Garrett.](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~garrett/coding/)
we will also follow Vic Reiner's notes on the subject, which can be found on his
[website](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/Classes/5251_Fall2021_syllabus.html). 

here is information about [coding theory using SageMath](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/coding/index.html), a free open-source mathematics software system.

## course logistics

grades will be earned through homework assignments, midterms, and a final.

- homework is 50% of grade
- each of two midterms are 15% of grade
- final exam is 20% of grade

## homework assignments

there will be 6 homework assignments
