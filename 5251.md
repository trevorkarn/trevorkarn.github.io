# math 5251 - error correcting codes, finite fields, algebraic curves - spring 2025

this is a course about the mathematics of transmitting information.
it is *not* a course about encoding/decoding messages for secrecy (cryptology).

we will primarily use [Paul Garrett's book](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~garrett/coding/CodingNotes.pdf) on the subject.
here is an [*unofficial* errata](https://trevorkarn.github.io/assets/5251/pgerrata.pdf) for the book.
the book is legally available for free on Garrett's website. [here are some more resources from Garrett.](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~garrett/coding/)
we will also follow Vic Reiner's notes on the subject, which can be found on his
[website](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/Classes/5251_Fall2024_syllabus.html).
additional textbooks are available through the UMN library.
i have provided links to the ones i find most interesting on Canvas.

here is information about [coding theory using SageMath](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/coding/index.html), a free open-source mathematics software system.

## course logistics

grades are earned using a mastery-based learning framework with 20 specifications, including 10 "core" specifications and 10 "advanced" specifications.  

## assignments

each week there is a homework and two quizzes. one quiz focuses on definitions relevant to upcoming course material. the other provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate mastery on specifications recently addressed in class.

## additional resources

some of the following resources may only be available with UMN library access.

- [first day of class parlor trick from Richard Ehrenborg](https://www.ms.uky.edu/~jrge/Papers/Hamming.pdf), 
- two more tricks from Todd Mateer

## questions

my students ask great questions. [here are the answers](/assets/5251/answers.pdf) to some of them.
